# Unit 7: Project 1

## Overview
Welcome to Project 1! This is an important step in your full-stack journey as you will now use your newly acquired skills and knowledge to build web application from scratch. With your team, you will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Because you will be working collaboratively, you will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

  * Server-side APIs

  * Agile software development

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:
  
  * Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project

  * Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

  * Resolve merge conflicts

  * Explain agile software development

  * Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages

  * Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. 

  * [01-swap-case](./03-Algorithms/01-swap-case)

  * [02-longest-word](./03-Algorithms/02-longest-word)

  * [03-acronym-builder](./03-Algorithms/03-acronym-builder)

  * [04-reverse-words](./03-Algorithms/04-reverse-words)
